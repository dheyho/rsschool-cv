### About me:

<p> Hello, my name is Denis, 20 y.o.. I'm a 3rd year student of the Belarusian National Technical University on the Information systems and Robotics faculty. I'd like to be a JS developer. In my free time I work a lot on myself: do sports (actually I like go to the gym), read books, learn JS.</p>

<p> This year I recognized that I want to be successful developer and I'll do everything for it. This is my aim. </p>
<p> My strengths are friendliness, communication, perseverance and desire to be better.</p>

### My skills

1. OOP
2. JS basics
3. HTML&CSS
4. Git
<p>So, not so a lot but I want to become better :)</p>

### Sample code

```javascript
function squareDigits(num){
let arr = num.toString().split('');
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
arr[i] = Math.pow(+arr[i], 2);
}
return Number(arr.join(''));
}
```
